# Image Processing Optimization on Embedded System

# Project Introduction
Abundant image-processing applications in embedded systems have been extensively utilized in various thriving industries, including the automotive, medical, and IoT sectors. 
However, the processing efficiency and storage limitations on embedded systems pose persistent challenges. 
Therefore, in this project, our goal is to optimize video image processing using specific techniques such as multithreading, neon intrinsics, and cache blocking. 
The entire process will be executed on a Raspberry Pi 4B, where the video will be converted into grayscale and subjected to a Sobel filter to enhance the edges of shapes in the video. <br />
